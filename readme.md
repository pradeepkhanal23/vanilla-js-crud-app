# Simple CRUD Web API Project with Local Storage

This is a simple project that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a web API using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Additionally, it utilizes local storage to persist data on the client-side, providing a seamless user experience. I have done this project to sharpen my skills in vanilla javascript.

## Features

- Create: Add new items to the API and store them locally.
- Read: Retrieve and display existing items from the API and local storage.
- Update: Edit and update existing items in the API and local storage.
- Delete: Remove items from the API and local storage.

## Local Storage

The project utilizes local storage to store data on the client-side. This ensures that your data remains available even if you refresh the page or close the browser. The local storage functionality is implemented using JavaScript.

## Customization

You can customize the project by modifying the following files:

- `index.html`: Modify the HTML structure and layout as needed.
- `styles.css`: Customize the CSS styles to match your desired design.
- `script.js`: Update the JavaScript code to handle the API interactions, local storage operations, and implement additional features.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific requirements.
